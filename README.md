# My-projects
This repository contains my Data Analytics projects, there are 3 projects :
- The IMDB data analytics project, which is about movies informations and ratings from the IMDB database, where i extracted some interessting informations
about the popular movies/genres and the features associated with them.
- The Twitter WeRateDogs data, it's a famous twitter acccount who rate dogs around the world, where i made some interessting codes to clean the data and extract 
the useful information.
- The sales data of 3 different supermarkets, where i compared between the 3 branches on different feautures to see which branch is profitable and which 
product line can make more profit for each branch.
